# SMART-EMISSION-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM
The purpose of this project is to build a robust system that can keep check on the amount of pollutants released by the vehicles into the atmosphere. Sudden environmental changes in pollution is one of the major contribution to environmental pollution. Increased number and usage of vehicles has reduced the quality of air and its surroundings and has even led to catastrophic problems in human beings.

Objectives of The Project
The main objective of the project is to reduce air pollution. The project aims at enabling facilities such as:
●To develop a device that blocks the supply of fuel to the engine.
●To deactivate the vehicle if the amount of pollutant level is beyond the specified threshold value.
●To display the amount of various of toxic gases released by the vehicle.
●To send a notification to the vehicle owner.
●To monitor real time vehicle emission standards and try to control pollution.
●To use cost-efficient and user-friendly system.

The System developed is tested before giving it to the customer. The components used i.e. the three sensors used are being tested for whether they are working properly or not. Then, they are installed on the Arduino and testing is carried out with the help of software Arduino IDE. The next step involves the testing of the GSM module for communication. The module is tested based on whether the proper notification is being sent to the vehicle owner. The final step corresponds to testing of the solenoid valve. The fuel supply should be blocked if the threshold value is breached. This testing is done based on the performance of the solenoid valve. Thus, the testing of the entire system is done in steps and the results are used for further proceedings.
